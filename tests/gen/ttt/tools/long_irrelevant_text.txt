        Once  upon a time, in a small village nestled at the foot of a mountain, there lived an old woman who had spent her entire life tending to her garden. She was known throughout the land for her beautiful flowers and lush vegetables, which she would sell at the local market every week. One day, as she was out picking her produce, she stumbled across a mysterious seed that she had never seen before. Without hesitation, she planted it in her garden and watched as it grew into the most magnificent tree she had ever seen. The tree bore fruit unlike any other, with juicy oranges that were filled with gold coins. The villagers were amazed by this newfound treasure and flocked to the old woman's house to get their share. From then on, the old woman became rich beyond her wildest dreams, all thanks to the magical seed she found in her garden.
